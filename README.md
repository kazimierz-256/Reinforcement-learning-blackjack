# Reinforcement Learning algorithm for learning the most advantageous strategy for a simplified version of Blackjack

## Blackjack variation used in the project
It is assumed that there is an infinite deck of cards and there are only 2 available actions to perform by the player and the dealer: Hit or Stand.

## I have put special effort into justifying my decisions on implementational details. Detailed explanations are available as comments in-between lines of code.

## Technologies used
* Python 3.8.0
* External packages:
  * Plotly
  * Numpy
